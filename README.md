Notes for Prompt engineering 

Persona Pattern
Explanation: This pattern involves creating a persona or character for the language model, which helps to guide its responses in a specific style or tone. This can improve personalization and target a particular audience effectively.
Example:
"You are an enthusiastic teacher explaining science to high school students."

Question Refinement Pattern
Explanation: This pattern is used to clarify or improve a user’s question, making it more precise and easier for the model to answer.
Example:
"Could you specify whether you mean historical significance or current political impact in your question?"

Cognitive Verifier Pattern
Explanation: In this pattern, the model checks its own reasoning process, verifying its logic or answers for accuracy and consistency.
Example:
"Let me double-check that information. If the capital of France is Paris, then the answer is correct."

Audience Persona Pattern
Explanation: This pattern tailors the model's responses based on the persona of the intended audience (e.g., children, experts, general public).
Example:
"Explain this concept as if I’m a 10-year-old."

Flipped Interaction Pattern
Explanation: This pattern reverses the typical roles in a conversation, where the model may ask questions first before providing answers, creating a more interactive experience.
Example:
"Before I answer, can you tell me what you already know about this topic?"

Few-shot Examples
Explanation: This pattern involves providing a few examples to the model to illustrate how it should respond to a given task. It helps the model understand the desired format and tone.
Example:
"Here’s how I want you to write a poem:

‘The sun sets slowly.’

‘The moon rises in its place.’
Now write a poem following this structure."

Chain of Thought Prompting
Explanation: This pattern encourages the model to explain its thought process step by step, which can help clarify its reasoning.
Example:
"Let’s think through this: First, we know the total number of apples is 12. If you divide that by 3, how many apples does each person get?"

ReAct Prompting
Explanation: ReAct Prompting combines reasoning and acting, where the model is encouraged to not just think but also take actions or make decisions based on reasoning.
Example:
"If you want to improve your study habits, first identify which study methods worked best last semester."

Using Large Language Models to Grade Each Other
Explanation: This involves using a language model to assess or grade other language models' responses, ensuring consistency and quality in the generated content.
Example:
"Please grade the following answer based on clarity, conciseness, and relevance."

Game Play Pattern
Explanation: This pattern uses a game-like structure to engage the model, often incorporating challenges, puzzles, or decision-making tasks for both the model and the user.
Example:
"Let's play a trivia game! I'll ask a question, and you try to answer it correctly."

Template Pattern
Explanation: This pattern involves using a predefined template for structuring responses, ensuring consistency across similar tasks.
Example:
"The template for writing a book review is:

Introduction

Summary of the plot

Analysis of characters

Conclusion"

Meta Language Creation Pattern
Explanation: In this pattern, the model creates a custom language or set of rules to address specific problems, enabling better communication for complex tasks.
Example:
"Let's use ‘X’ for something we don’t know yet and ‘Y’ for what we’ve already figured out."

Recipe Pattern
Explanation: This pattern organizes information as a recipe or step-by-step guide, providing clear instructions for performing a task.
Example:
"To bake a cake:

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Mix flour, sugar, and eggs.

Bake for 25 minutes."

Alternative Approaches Pattern
Explanation: This pattern involves offering multiple ways to approach a problem or task, allowing flexibility and creative solutions.
Example:
"If you need to learn programming, you can:

Take an online course.

Read programming books.

Join coding communities."

Ask for Input Pattern
Explanation: This pattern prompts the model to ask the user for clarification or input, encouraging more interactive and dynamic exchanges.
Example:
"Could you tell me more about your specific needs so I can help you better?"

Outline Expansion Pattern
Explanation: This pattern starts with a basic outline of ideas and then expands each section into a more detailed explanation.
Example:
"Here’s an outline for a research paper:

Introduction

Methodology

Results

Discussion
Now, let’s expand each section."

Menu Actions Pattern
Explanation: This pattern presents the user with a set of options to choose from, often in the form of a menu, and the model responds based on the selection.
Example:
"Please select an option:

Learn about programming.

Ask for coding help.

Find coding resources."

Fact Check List Pattern
Explanation: This pattern is used to ensure that a response is accurate by checking it against a predefined list of facts or criteria.
Example:
"To verify this claim, check the following facts:

Does the source support the claim?

Is the data recent?

Are the statistics accurate?"

Tail Generation Pattern
Explanation: This pattern focuses on generating a closing or concluding statement to complete a response or task, often helping to tie everything together.
Example:
"To wrap up, remember: Consistency is key in achieving your goals."

Semantic Filter Pattern
Explanation: This pattern involves filtering responses based on the meaning or relevance of the words, ensuring the output matches the desired context and intent.
Example:
"Please filter out any irrelevant terms and focus only on the key points related to climate change."
